## Objective

_Problem Statement_
How has Kanye's changed as an artist and person and what can we learn using machine learning about detecting bipolar tendencies and behavior changes?

## Data

1. Find source for lyrics and create function to access API for each song
  - 
  
1. Create song list of Kanye's body of work
  - Fill in missing songs
  
1. Prep text into corpus
  - stop words (preloaded and custom)
  - stemming
1. Vectorize words for use in model
  - _Count Vectorizer_ Count Frequency
  - _TFIDF Vectorizer_ Term Frequency times inverse document frequency (TFIDF)

## Models

- Topic Modeling using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and non-negative matrix factorization (NMF)
  - evaluation convergenc
- Word 2 Vec for word grouping
## Analysis

- Change

## Futurework

## Takeaways
